								<h3>Steve Jobs</h3>

								</div>
								<div class="accordion-content">
								<p>
									Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 &ndash; October 5, 2011) 
									was an American businessman. He was best known as the co-founder, 
									chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple Inc.; CEO and 
									largest shareholder of Pixar Animation Studios;a member of The Walt 
									Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; 
									and founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT Inc. <br /><br />
							
									Jobs is widely recognized as 
									a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s, along with Apple 
									co-founder Steve Wozniak. <br /><br />
							
									Shortly after his death, Jobs's official biographer, Walter Isaacson, 
									described him as the "creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection 
									and ferocious drive revolutionized six 
									industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, 
									tablet computing, and digital publishing."</p>

										<h3>NeXT</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-content">
								<p>
									NeXT, Inc. (later NeXT Computer, Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc) was an American computer 
									company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that developed and manufactured a series of 
									computer workstations intended for the higher education and business markets. <br /><br />

									NeXT was founded in 1985 by Apple Computer cofounder Steve Jobs, after he was forced out of Apple, 
									along with a few of his coworkers. <br /><br />

									Nevertheless, their innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment 
									were highly influential. <br /><br />

									The NeXT Computer and this object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system was the platform used for 
									creating the World Wide Web as well as creating the first App Store which was originally 
									demonstrated to Steve Jobs in 1993. <br /><br />

									Apple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. 
									As part of the agreement, Steve Jobs, Chairman and CEO of NeXT Software, returned to Apple, 
									the company he had cofounded in 1976.[2] The merger promised to marry software from NeXT with Apple's 
									hardware platforms, eventually resulting in OS X, iOS, and watchOS. Parts of these operating systems 
									incorporated the OPENSTEP foundation.</p>
								
								<br />
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-toggle">
										<h3>Objective-C</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-content">
								<p>
									Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main 
									programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.<br /><br />

									The programming language Objective-C was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, 
									from which OS X and iOS are derived.[2] Portable Objective-C programs that do not use the Cocoa or Cocoa Touch libraries, or those using parts that may be ported or 
									reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by GCC or Clang.</p>

												<p>NeXTSTEP is a discontinued object-oriented, multitasking operating system based on UNIX, which was developed by NeXT Computer in the late 1980s and early 1990s. <br /><br />
												It was initially used for its range of proprietary workstation computers such as the NeXTcube and later ported to several other computer architectures.  <br /><br />
												Although relatively unsuccessful at the time, it attracted interest from computer scientists and researchers. <br /><br />
												It was used as the original platform for the development of the first AppStore</p>
											</div>
											<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
												<p>Some features and keyboard shortcuts now commonly found in web browsers can be traced to NeXTSTEP conventions. The basic layout options of HTML 1.0 and 2.0 
												are attributable to those features available in NeXT's Text class. <br /><br />
												
												The software that controlled MCI's Friends and Family program was developed using NeXTSTEP. NeXTSTEP was even used to control the deposition of advanced 
												semi-conductors with Riber's Accessible (section 2.5) and Hughes Research Labs EpiCenter software.</p>
											</div>
											<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
												<p>With the iPhone, Objective-C and the NeXTSTEP libraries (prefixed NS) have found a second life, yet in 1989, this was a software development environement 
												that was way ahead of its time, which started to have some serious competition at least two years later with PowerBuilder. <br /><br />
												Objective-C is a reflective, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. </p>
