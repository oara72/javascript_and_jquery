WEB303 Assignment 4
Chapter 8: APIs

In this assignment we will use JavaScript location and web storage APIs.

Note: If you have problems, upload your files to the php.scweb.ca server. Web storage is dependant on the domain, 
	it might not work properly from the local filesystem.

1. Use geolocation to find the current location and display it on the page.
2. Store the current location values in localstorage.
3. Compare the new value with the old value and display a message to show how far the person has moved.
	(function provided to calculate the distance between two lat/long pairs.)
4. Display a welcome message if the person is visiting for the first time (no location stored). Display a different message if localstorage is not available.
5. Display a suitable message if geolocation is not available.

Upload this final script.js file to Blackboard.
