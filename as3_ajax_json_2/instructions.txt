WEB303 Assignment 3
Chapter 8: AJAX and JSON

In this assignment we will use Ajax to fetch a JSON format file and insert the content into the page.

Note: Either upload your files to the scweb.ca server or use Firefox. Chrome and Safari have problems loading Ajax from the filesystem.

1. Use the .getJSON() method to get the team.json file.
2. Use the $.each() method to loop through the elements of the array in the object.
3. For each object insert the name, title, and bio into the div#team. Put the name in an h3, the title in an h4, and the bio in a p.

Make a copy of your As03 folder called Aso3b.

4. Modify your code to use the .ajax() method using the HTTP "get" type.
5. Add a callback that runs before the Ajax call is made. Display the text "Loading..." in the div#team.
6. Add an error callback to display an alert with the error message.
7. Set a timeout of 5 seconds.
8. Display the data in the same way as above. Make sure you remove the "Loading..." message.

Upload this final script.js file to Blackboard.
